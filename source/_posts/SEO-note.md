# 名詞解釋

## Web copy = 網頁文案
- Web copy is the bones of your website. It’s the core text that guides people through your site and tells them what they need to know.
- Web copy is copywriting for your website, found on all the major pages on your site. It’s designed to sell your products or services to people once they’ve found you.

## Web content = 網頁內容？
- Blog posts are web content. In fact, pretty much any piece of writing on the internet can be classed as ‘web content’.
